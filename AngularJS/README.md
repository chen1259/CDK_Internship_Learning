# Shaping Up With AngularJS

This is a course I took on codeschool for angularjs

### Level 1

This whole level is about starting to create modules and using the built-in
directives we are given.  We also talk about controllers and setting up html so that 
we can use angular correctly.

### Level 2

We learn more about built-in directives and how to make more complex controllers.  Stuff like 
for loops for directives and images.

### Level 3

We learn how to make angular work with forms.  We show how the 2 way binding works
in order to make the html work with and js and vice versa.  

### Level 4

We make our own directives and learn how to refactor our code within those directives
so that everything is more meaningful instead of scrolling through the code to get a general
idea.

### Level 5

We learn about services, dependancy injections, how to refactor a module, and also some built-in
services with Angular like $http, $log, etc.
